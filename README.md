# QuizSoftwareCompScience1
This application allows a single player to take a quiz by reading a txt file. The quiz tracks the questions the player answered correctly. The program reads a file to populate the questions. It ends by displaying information about the player’s correct responses and current “level”. The program utilizes 2 structures, the reading of a file, a function to open an output file and save the player data to the file. It allows multiple players to take the quiz during the same session. It indicates who has the higher score (“winner” identified). It saves the player results to an output file and restore the file when a player runs the application. Players can save their highest score achieved. If an existing player has data in the file, it displays an appropriate message about their highest score achieved so far and encourage them for this round of play. It displays a “top 5 scores list”. 

### It contains examples of:
- Conditional statements and loops
- Use of structures and single dimension arrays of structures
- Functions to do all of the major work, with the main function calling other functions to get work done, passing structures to functions
- C++ string objects to hold text literals
- File input/output
